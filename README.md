# Guided_differentiation

Code used in the analysis of data generated from scRNA-seq of guided differentiation cell cultures.

The Rmarkdown file contains 3 analyses:

1) Analysis and manual cell type annotation of guided differentiation cell cultures using Seurat. This code produces Figures 1B and 1C, as well as Supplemental Figures 2 and 3.
  
2) Seurat integration and analysis of a 16-day iPSC-CM differentiation time-course dataset published by Elorbany et al. (2022), and the guided differentiation dataset. This code produces Figure 2 as well as Supplemental Figure 4.

3) Automated annotation of cells from guided differentiation cell cultures, mature multilineage organoids published by Silva, et al. (2021), and a PBMC dataset from 10x Genomics. Automated annotation was performed using the scPred prediction model trained on annotated fetal heart cells published by Miao et al. (2020). This code produces Figures 3A, 3C, and 3D, as well as Supplemental Figure 5.
